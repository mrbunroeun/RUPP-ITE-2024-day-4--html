    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is hiking. It allows me to connect with nature, explore new places, and challenge myself physically.</p>

    <h3>Here are 3 things I enjoy about hiking:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The beautiful scenery</li>
        <li>The peacefulness of being outdoors</li>
        <li>The sense of accomplishment after completing a hike</li>
    </ul>
